                                <p>A students’ union hence protects the rights and interests of the students. The students have for a long time been a certain class representing enlightenment and growth of the society. As these two fields have faced certain difficulties throughout history, they needed their own union. And thus began the struggle.
                                </p>
                                <p>The students’ unions date back to the pre first world-war era. During the war the students’ of many universities had to either join the army or stay back and protect the universities, which included digging of trenches and sandbagging. After the war many of the students returned to complete their degrees and thus the students’ unions gained some power and began pressurizing the authorities for better facilities for the students. Post-1960s saw the students unions shedding political light with protests against the Vietnam War and apartheid. Also began the organization of student festivals. Since then the students’ unions all around the globe have continued their struggle, and they will continue to do so as long as the students still own their minds.
                                </p>
                                <p>The students’ union of <strong>Presidency University</strong> have also been securing the rights of the students and representing them on different fronts. We have upheld the ideology of non-partisanship while staying independent. In other words, we have constructed a platform of the students, by the students and for the students. The practice of organizing Union General Body Meetings has kept our processes democratic and our struggle against forces preventing the students from securing power has stayed strong.
                                </p>
                                <p>A union is an idea, a flexible idea. Students’ unions now no longer remain within the bounds of a single university. There are organizations such as West African Students' Union (WASU), an association of students from various West African countries who were studying in the United Kingdom. Student Unions have also moved away from just working for students’ right and have raised strong voices against political injustice. Like the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) who led the six-year Assam Movement against alleged illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.
                                </p>
                                <p>Presidency's student community has always been socially and politically conscious and have been at the forefront of revolutionary movements since the struggle for Independence from British colonialists. Presidency was also the epicentre of the Naxalite movement in the 70s (more about that period can found at this <strong><a href="https://naxalrevolution.wordpress.com/category/history/" target="_blank">link</a></strong>). The current Union is committed to continuing that legacy of rising to our social responsibilities through awareness building about different issues, protests against societal injustice and various public service programmes. </p>
                                <p>As of now the only way to secure rights for students all across the globe is to be united in one single struggle. A struggle of non-partisan nature, against any force which stands to prevent democracy and self-determinism. The students’ union stands as a platform to raise the voices of the students and leading their movements. The students’ union stands as an answer.</p>
